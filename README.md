# javascript-challenge

## Background

For this project, I was tasked to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset provided](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). I also needed to allow the users to filter the table data for specific values. 

## My Task

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* I created a basic HTML web page seen at [Index.html](UFO-level-1/index.html)

* Using the [UFO dataset](UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js) provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * I made sure to include the following columns in the table - `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* I used a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

The Javascript for the above items can be seen [here](UFO-level-1/statis/js/app.js).
